# CTF-TOOL
(future stuff)
A tool for building modular CTFs with minimum effort.

# Concepts
## Challenges:
| Challenges Type    | Definition |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Machine-Required   | Machine-required challenges are similar to both standard and service-required problems but instead require a dedicated machine to be presented to the players. This type is planned for future and not currently supported.
| Container-required | Same as Machine-required but use containers instead of machines. Also planned for future and not currently supported.
